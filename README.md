# Visualizing-US-Population-Data-with-PowerBI
This project visualizes United States population data.
## Data Understanding
The data for this visualization project was gotten from usafacts.org. It contains population data of the united states from 1900 to 2022. it includes demographics population data such as age groups, gender and race. This project will only use data from 2011 onwards. 
## Data Preparation
The data preparation is carried out in power query. The first step is to remove the data for years that is not needed (1900 - 2010). 
 This table shows data from 1900 before deletion. delete_years
 
This table shows data from 2011 after deleting the previous years data. kept_years

The data is then seperated based on demographics such as age, gender and race.
